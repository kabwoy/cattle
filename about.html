         <center>We are focused on helping cattle producers better manage their livestock, for a better life.</center>

<h1>Mission</h1>
We started Toca because we wanted to provide a better solution for small farmers across Kenya and Africa at large
who want peace of mind knowing that their cattle numbers are being recorded accurately and consistently. 
There has been a lack of focus on accurate cattle registration in the past so we're making a 
change that will make a positive impact on both the financials and overall well being of our fellow countrymen.

At Toca, we are extremely passionate about helping small to medium 
sized farmers with their cattle record keeping. We see ourselves as partners with other farmers and 
committed to making sure the work we do helps them grow.

We're a business-focused & consumer-friendly approach to better manage your herd whether you have one or 1000 head.

<h1>Our Beginnings</h1>
Started in 2020 by founder Moshood Abiola, Toca was developed to fill the void of 
technology in the farming world.

Moshood, growing up on a farm and later running his own farm, saw the 
need for tools like Toca to help with the day to day operations of running a farm. He would later start 
a career in web development where he learned the skills necessary to start Toca.

Once Toca launched in late 2020, we have been working hand in hand with 
farmers all across the country. Taking their needs and finding solutions to improve their 
quality of life. We are very proud of Toca and love working with the farmers.
